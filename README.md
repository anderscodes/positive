# pstve+

pstve+ is a pet project to build a positive messaging service that delivers a positive message to a user and encourages them to send one back. This project will start off very simple and grow as my skills grow.

# Command Line Version

The first iteration of the messaging service is a version that runs on the command line and returns a positive message before asking for a positive message in response. The input positive message that is also saved in the array of messages and the full array of messages is returned at the end.

# Screenshots
